# Analyzing-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
### I used summary statistics and filters to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools!
## Project Description

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.
In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.
I looked at how performance varied by borough, identified how many schools failed to report information, and found the top ten performing schools across the city!
